  <p>Welcome to the Virtual Pet Cafe!</p>

  <p>Our goal is to provide a wonderful place for you to relax and enjoy our amazing virtual pets. 
Here you can play with our pets or create your own pets for a custom experience.</p>

  <p>No room for a big dog? No problem. Your virtual pets fit anywhere. Travel too much? We've got you covered. 
Your virtual pets can go anywhere you have an internet connection. Hate that smelly litter box? 
One of the best things about a virtual pet is that they don't need one!</p>
